# So how it work

By fetching films via imdb_ids core script of the app get the almost random film names and transform them into the names with secret word(only nouns and "nouns-like" words) replaced by Oleg.
Users should take a guess what is hidden in a secret word. If they do it right, system will give them points as a reward. 
Top 10 users will be displayed in index page.

I hope you enjoy my work. Feel free to fork it!
